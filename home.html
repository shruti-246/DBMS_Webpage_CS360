    <h1>Welcome to University of Idaho</h1>
    <p>Explore stunning photography from the University of Idaho.</p>
    <p>The University of Idaho Library’s Campus Photograph Collection is a collection of digitized historical images of the University of Idaho campus, focusing on the physical structures that populate the U of I’s main campus in Moscow, Idaho. This digital collection is mostly taken from the library’s Special Collections and Archive’s U of I Historic Campus Photographs Collection, which is referred to as Photograph Group 1 (PG1). The collection comprises thousands of images spanning from 1889 to the early 1990s and includes photography of buildings that have been demolished, added-on-to, or moved (in a couple cases). Color images of recent buildings added to campus since the 1970s have been added for continuity.
        The U of I’s colleges, schools, and organizations have often changed buildings several times in campus history to accommodate cultural change and academic growth. For example, the Armory is a title that has been owned by three different buildings, one of which no longer exists. Thus, it is very important to note the dates for which one is seeking images. For example, if one is looking for a building that is not listed on our buildings page or in the drop-down menu at right, they can use the search box to find the building sought (e.g. ‘infirmary’ or ‘dairy barn’.) This photo collection also includes a limited number of academic activities and individuals. These images can also be found by using a keyword search (e.g. ‘biological’ or ‘Alf Dunn’.)</p>
